## Cookbook for Kubernetes Storage

### Viewing the Cookbook

The HTML-readable version of the cookbook is available via https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/kubernetes-storage-cookbook/.

### Building the Cookbook locally

The Cookbook for ICP Solution Architects is written to support [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and can be built into a book-readable format by following standard Markdown writing styles and MkDocs build processes.

1. Install MkDocs locally following the [official documentation instructions](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).
2. Clone the code and serve pages locally as follows:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/kubernetes-storage-cookbook.git
	cd kubernetes-storage-cookbook
	mkdocs serve
	```
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

### Pushing the Cookbook to GitHub Pages
**FORK** this repository first, then clone it as follows:
```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=PUT_YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE
git clone git@github.com:${GITHUB_USERNAME}/kubernetes-storage-cookbook.git
cd kubernetes-storage-cookbook
```

1. Ensure that all your local changes to the `master` branch have been committed and pushed to the remote repository.
   1. `git push origin master`
2. Ensure that you have the latest commits to the `gh-pages` branch.
	```bash
	git checkout gh-pages
	git pull origin gh-pages
	git checkout master
	```
3. Run `mkdocs gh-deploy` from the root directory.  Note that the `gh-deploy` command will fail if you do not have the latest commits to the branch pulled locally.
	* If you have git remote links for both this repository and your fork, you will need to run the command with an extra flag. For example, here is a local clone of the code that has 2 remote repos: `fabio` (fork) and `origin` (main repo):
	```bash
	fabio	git@github.com:fabiogomezdiaz/kubernetes-storage-cookbook.git (fetch)
	fabio	git@github.com:fabiogomezdiaz/kubernetes-storage-cookbook.git (push)
	origin	https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/kubernetes-storage-cookbook.git (fetch)
	origin	https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/kubernetes-storage-cookbook.git (push)
	```
	* To deploy the MkDocs pages to the `fabio` repo, you will need to run the command as `mkdocs gh-deploy -r fabio`
4. Open `https://${GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io/kubernetes-storage-cookbook/` to see
